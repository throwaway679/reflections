When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
As a backup in case local files are corrupted or lost. In the case of github, to share
my work and code with others, and to receive contributions.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the remote repository might be contributed to by others, and I wouldn't want their
work overwriting mine unwittingly.
