What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up Git in that directory. To do this, it creates a .git directory
which records a log of all future operations in that directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate state between working directory and repository.
It holds files that are ready to be committed to the repository. It allows one
to gather a collection of edits/changes before committing them all together in
one batch to the repo.
